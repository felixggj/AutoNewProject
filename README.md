# Python Script to Automate New Project Creation
*Felix Gomez-Guillamon Jurado*
## Description
The process of starting a new project is a repetitive one. 

This script automates the process of creating a new project folder, creating a new conda virtual environment with a specified python version, creating a new git repository, and automatically opening VSCODE in the new project folder.

Once the script is run, I can immediately install the necessary packages for the specified project and begin coding.

## Important Info

- It is recommended to add the script to your PATH variable so that it can be run from anywhere.
- The script requires that you have conda installed and that you have a conda environment named "base" installed.
- The script requires that you have git installed.
- The script requires that you have VSCode installed.

## Other

- The script is very adaptable. It can be modified to fit your needs.
